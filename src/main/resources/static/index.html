This is Mock Service and Ticketing System
<p>==========</p>
<p>This is an AI Autonomous agent built using Tools4AI and OpenAI, Gemini. <a href="https://github.com/vishalmysore/Tools4AI"> Please visit Tools4AI for more Info</a> </p>
</p>Using Tools4AI function calling (tools integration) with OpenAI is simple and efficient. When a user provides a prompt, Tools4AI dynamically determines which group the prompt
belongs to, using AI. Then, it calls the action associated with that group. In under 10 minutes, you can kickstart your journey to developing an autonomous agent in Java by
leveraging the power of OpenAI. All you need is your OpenAI key and, of course, a refreshing cup of coffee (or tea) .
